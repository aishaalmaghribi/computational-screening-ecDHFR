# In Silico Identification of Natural Product Inhibitors of E. coli Dihydrofolate Reductase

## Project Overview
This repository contains computational work identifying Berberine and Rosmarinic Acid as potential inhibitors of E. coli DHFR (ecDHFR) through molecular docking and ADME profiling.

**Key Findings:**
- **Berberine:** High binding affinity (-8.8 kcal/mol), good oral bioavailability, but CYP450 inhibition risk
- **Rosmarinic Acid:** Excellent binding affinity (-9.0 kcal/mol), clean safety profile, but poor absorption
