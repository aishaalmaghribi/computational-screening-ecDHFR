# Methods
## Molecular Docking
- **Target:** ecDHFR (PDB: 1RF7)
- **Tool:** CB-Dock web server
- **Approach:** Blind docking with AutoDock Vina
- **Ligands:** 10 natural products from PubChem

### ADME Profiling
- **Tool:** SwissADME
- **Parameters:** GI absorption, BBB penetration, CYP inhibition, drug-likeness

# Key Results Files
- results/docking/ - Docked complexes and interaction analysis
- results/adme/ - Pharmacokinetic predictions
- manuscript/final_manuscript.pdf - Complete research paper

## How to Reproduce
1. Docking results were generated via CB-Dock web server
2. Input files are in data/raw/
3. Results are documented in results/

# Limitations
- Computational predictions require experimental validation
- Blind docking may identify non-biological binding sites
