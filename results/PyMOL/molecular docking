Virtual screening against ecDHFR  via the CB-DOCK server nominated two natural compounds as high-affinity binders “Table 2” Rosmarinic acid and Berberine. 
Romarinic acid demonstrated the most potent predicted binding (Vina score:-9.0 kcal/mol) with Berberinen also exhibiting strong affinity( Vina scores ≤ -8.7 kcal/mol). A key finding was the consistent localization of both hits to the same active site (Cavity Volume: 2605 Å³), confirming specific engagement of the enzyme’s catalytic pocket and providing structural rationale for their predicted inhibitory activity.
